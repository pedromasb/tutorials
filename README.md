# Jupyter Notebook tutorials

This repository was born out of the spirit of sharing useful Python features, mainly related to data science and analysis, that I have come across. With this in mind, the notebooks will use a practical case to show these features so that anyone can discover and benefit from them.

I will also collect here personal projects and tutorials developed during my research in astrophysics and data science.

Enjoy them! ðŸ‘‹

### VO with Python: working with PyVO and MOCPy 
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](notebooks/VO_with_python.ipynb) &nbsp; [![Google Colab Badge](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CehMdQLCb98PEFmzRBdm7mYycS6fJH59?usp=sharing)

This tutorial explores the usage of PyVO and MOCPy, two powerful products for accesing the [Virtual Observatory](https://ivoa.net/) from Python. It was developed for the schools organized by the Spanish Virutal Observatory ([SVO](https://svo.cab.inta-csic.es/docs/index.php?pagename=Meetings)).

### Dimensionality Reduction for Data Visualization With Python
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](notebooks/dimreduction_solarspots.ipynb) &nbsp; [![Google Colab Badge](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mL6W7jnn0CSsySdUtBqa_O6FQ7xsJmNd?usp=sharing)

In this brief tutorial, we will explore the use of dimensionality reduction focused on finding a good visualization of our global data context. We will build our use case around the data provided by the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations ([SILSO](https://www.sidc.be/silso/home)) on the monthly mean total sunspot number, which is obtained as a simple arithmetic mean of the daily value. You can see more info on how the daily total sunspot number (Wolf number) is derived [here](https://www.sidc.be/silso/infosndtot).

### Using Grid Search For Autoencoder Hyperparameter Tuning
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](notebooks/gridsearch_autoencoder.ipynb) &nbsp; [![Google Colab Badge](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gKjQbwJ7HUwHbZMESLgyIP2kA-Me9wB1?usp=sharing)

In this brief tutorial, we will see how we can use the grid search tuning technique for the hyperparameter optimization of a deep sparse autoencoder. You can learn about how autoencoders work [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-deep-learning-part-3-autoencoders-1c083af4d798). We will use the well known [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database of handwritten digits, which is available through the ``tensorflow.keras.datasets`` module.

### Interactive Plotting With Python: From Zero to Hero ðŸš€
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](notebooks/interactive_viz_python.ipynb) &nbsp; [![Google Colab Badge](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ENG47JiT2q4pi21enoUN-_l4--v8TL8P?usp=sharing)

This demo shows how to get the most out of interactive data sharing in `Python` using `plotly`, providing:

- A template for an extensive customisation of the plots.

- A function to create an html dashboard with `plotly` figures for data sharing.
