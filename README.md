# Jupyter Notebook tutorials

This repository was born out of the spirit of sharing useful Python features, mainly related to data science and analysis, that I have come across. With this in mind, the notebooks will use a practical case to show these features so that anyone can discover and benefit from them.

I will also collect here personal projects and tutorials developed during my research in astrophysics and data science.

Enjoy them! ðŸ‘‹

### VO with Python: working with PyVO and MOCPy 
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](notebooks/VO_with_python.ipynb) [![Google Colab Badge](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CehMdQLCb98PEFmzRBdm7mYycS6fJH59?usp=sharing)

This tutorial explores the usage of PyVO and MOCPy, two powerful products for accesing the [Virtual Observatory](https://ivoa.net/) from Python. It was developed for the schools organized by the Spanish Virutal Observatory ([SVO](https://svo.cab.inta-csic.es/docs/index.php?pagename=Meetings)).
